 </body>Through every laugh and every tear,
Your love has grown year after year.
Mom’s gentle care, Dad’s steady hand,
Together you've built a love so grand.

In every hug, in every smile,
You’ve walked through life, mile by mile.
A love so pure, it will not end—
Mom and Dad, my heart’s best friends.
